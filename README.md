# Computational Physics using Fortran

The purpose of this repository is to introduce methods of numerical simulation of deterministic and random processes.

For example:
> Bessel's equation arises when finding separable solutions to Laplace's equation and the Helmholtz equation in cylindrical or spherical coordinates. Bessel functions are therefore especially important for many problems of wave propagation and static potentials
